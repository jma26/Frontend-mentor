### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped solidified my understanding of vanilla CSS (flexbox + css variables). If I were to continue working on it, I need to work on making the card fully responsive for desktop and mobile. At the moment, there isn't optimal breathing space around  the card on mobile screens and is not consistent on different screen sizes.

Next focus is to practice more on mobile-first designs and scaling it up to larger desktop screens
